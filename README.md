## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended)
- **Alpaca trading account** (paper or live)

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required: Alpaca API Credentials
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Optional: Override default settings
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/trading.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 2. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd autotrader

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f autotrader

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

This starts:
- **AutoTrader Pro** (main trading system)
- **Dashboard** (automatically started at http://localhost:8501)
- **Redis** (for caching)

### 3. Local Development with UV

AutoTrader Pro is designed to work seamlessly with [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the modern Python package manager.

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# For dashboard (optional - installs Streamlit)
uv pip install -e .[dashboard]

# For full development setup
uv pip install -e .[dev]

# Run the complete system using uv
uv run python run_complete.py

# Or start individual components
uv run uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
uv run streamlit run src/dashboard/main.py --server.port 8501

# Run main trading system
uv run python src/main_automated.py

# Run tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Use convenience scripts (Windows)
scripts\run_with_uv.bat api        # Start API only
scripts\run_with_uv.bat dashboard  # Start dashboard only
scripts\run_with_uv.bat complete   # Start complete system

# Use convenience scripts (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x scripts/run_with_uv.sh
./scripts/run_with_uv.sh api       # Start API only
./scripts/run_with_uv.sh dashboard # Start dashboard only
./scripts/run_with_uv.sh complete  # Start complete system

# Run the system (dashboard starts automatically)
uv run python run.py
```

### 4. Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize trading parameters:

```yaml
trading:
  max_positions: 15              # Maximum concurrent positions
  max_daily_loss: 2000.0        # Daily loss limit ($)
  position_size_percent: 0.03   # Position size (3% of portfolio)
  stop_loss_percent: 0.03       # Stop loss (3%)
  take_profit_percent: 0.08     # Take profit (8%)

screening:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 */1 * * *"        # Every hour
  max_symbols: 50
  criteria:
    min_price: 5.0
    max_price: 500.0
    min_volume: 250000
```

### 5. Broker Configuration

AutoTrader Pro supports multiple brokers with a simple, modular configuration system. **You only use one broker at a time**, but switching is easy.

#### Quick Setup

1. **Choose Your Broker**
   ```bash
   # Set in your .env file
   ACTIVE_BROKER=alpaca  # or: interactive_brokers, demo_broker
   ```

2. **Add Your Credentials**
   ```bash
   # For Alpaca
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   
   # For Interactive Brokers
   IB_API_KEY=your_ib_key
   IB_SECRET_KEY=your_ib_secret
   ```

3. **Set Active Broker**
   ```bash
   # config.yaml - all configured brokers are available
   # Use environment variable to choose which one is active
   ACTIVE_BROKER=alpaca  # or: interactive_brokers, demo_broker
   ```

#### Broker Management CLI

Use the built-in CLI tool for easy broker management:

```bash
# Check current status
python scripts/broker_cli.py status

# Switch brokers instantly
python scripts/broker_cli.py set demo_broker
python scripts/broker_cli.py set alpaca

# List available brokers
python scripts/broker_cli.py list

# Show environment template
python scripts/broker_cli.py env
```

#### Supported Brokers

- **Alpaca** - Commission-free trading with excellent API
- **Interactive Brokers** - Professional trading platform
- **Demo Broker** - Testing and development (no real money)

See [Broker Configuration Guide](docs/BROKER_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.
